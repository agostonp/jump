Functional reqs
This is a game where you have a 2d screen of leaves hovering on the surface of a lake. There is a bird jumping around from leaf to leaf. Leaves sink slowly under the bird and the bird has to stay above water. Certain leaves have some birdfood on top of it. The bird completes a level when it collected all the food. It loses a life if it sunks. The user can move the bird with keyboard arrows. Sunk leaves reappear later with random timing.

Tech reqs
Make it a web based game, use typescript and React in frontend.
